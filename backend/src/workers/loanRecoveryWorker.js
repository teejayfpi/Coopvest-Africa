/**
 * Loan Recovery Worker — Coopvest Africa Loan Policy (Section 4.1)
 *
 * Runs daily to enforce the 3-stage loan recovery process:
 *
 *   Stage 1 — 1st missed month:
 *     Automated repayment reminders sent via email and in-app notifications.
 *
 *   Stage 2 — 2nd consecutive missed month:
 *     A ₦3,000 late repayment charge is applied to the outstanding balance.
 *     An escalation notice is issued to the borrower.
 *     Admin is notified of the default status.
 *
 *   Stage 3 — 3rd consecutive missed month:
 *     Guarantors are contacted. Loan recovery process is initiated.
 *     Admin dashboard is alerted. Additional recovery actions apply.
 *
 * NOTE: The ₦3,000 penalty is NOT applied on the first missed payment.
 * It is applied only after the 2nd consecutive missed month.
